# Anomaly Detection & Clustering in High-Dimensional Data

## Overview

In real-world data, patterns often hide in complex, high-dimensional spaces. Detecting those patterns ‚Äî or deviations from them ‚Äî is crucial for everything from **fraud detection** and **network security** to **market segmentation** and **fault monitoring**.

This project explores the power of **unsupervised learning** to:

* Discover natural groupings in unlabeled data using clustering techniques
* Identify unusual data points through anomaly detection
* Reduce dimensional complexity with advanced reduction techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP

## Why This Project Matters

Unlike supervised learning, where labeled data is readily available, most real-world datasets are **unlabeled**. Unsupervised techniques allow us to extract insights without explicit labels. This is invaluable in domains like:

* **Cybersecurity:** Detecting outliers that could indicate intrusions
* **Finance:** Spotting irregular transactions
* **Healthcare:** Identifying rare diseases or patient clusters
* **Marketing:** Segmenting customers for targeted campaigns

With the growing scale and complexity of data, it's becoming essential to combine **clustering**, **dimensionality reduction**, and **anomaly detection** to make data interpretable and actionable.

## Why I Took On This Project

This project challenged me to:

* Think beyond labels and ground-truth answers
* Work with high-dimensional and noisy data
* Explore real-world strategies to simplify and make sense of complex datasets

It helped sharpen my understanding of:

* Clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering
* Dimensionality reduction tools like PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE
* Anomaly detection models such as Isolation Forest and LOF

## Project Highlights

* **Dimensionality Reduction** for visualization and computational efficiency
* **Clustering Analysis** to reveal patterns and groupings
* **Anomaly Detection** to catch rare and suspicious data points
* Clean, modular codebase built with scalability and reproducibility in mind

## Dataset

This project uses a high-dimensional, unlabeled dataset to simulate a real-world use case where we must uncover structure and detect outliers ‚Äî all without labels.

## Outcome

This project deepened my understanding of the **core unsupervised learning toolkit** and showed how it can be applied in **security, business intelligence, and operations**. It was also a stepping stone toward more advanced topics like **representation learning and generative models**.
* Visual clustering of normal vs abnormal traffic
* Detection of unknown intrusions using unsupervised methods
* Insights into high-risk traffic patterns via dimensionality plots
* Evaluation using labeled attack data (optional final step)
